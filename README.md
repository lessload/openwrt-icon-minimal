## openwrt-icon-minimal
Icon set for OpenWRT to provide a better indicator.
original icon in openwrt is too pain. hard to indicate which one on or off. switch, bridge, ethernet icon look too similar. that why i create new icon set.

All icon was from https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/

under licence https://pictogrammers.com/docs/general/license/ (Apache 2.0)

### Sample Picture
